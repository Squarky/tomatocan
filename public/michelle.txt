- On http://localhost:3000/merchandises/standardperks page, draw attention at top of page to Documents and maybe one other perk, then list the rest on the bottom.  Make it prettier.

Week of Sept 24:
look at merchpdf_uploader.rb and merchandises_controller_test.rb.
The PDF gets saved as a file.  How to test whether a file a) exists and b) gets uploaded?  
Also may change merchandises_controller_test to somewhere besides test/integration
Should do more tutorial at home, but probably wonâ€™t
